import subprocess
Sure! Here's a Python script for an AI chatbot that helps the user run the "main.py" program locally on their PC:

```python

# Function to run the main.py program


def run_program():
    try:
        subprocess.run(["python", "main.py"])
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: Unable to find the main.py file.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while running the program.\n{e}")

# Function to handle user input and execute commands


def handle_command(command):
    if command.lower() == "run":
        run_program()
    elif command.lower() == "help":
        print("Available commands:")
        print(" - run: Run the main.py program")
        print(" - help: Show available commands")
        print(" - exit: Quit the chatbot")
    elif command.lower() == "exit":
        print("Goodbye!")
        exit()
    else:
        print("Invalid command. Type 'help' to see available commands.")


# Main loop
while True:
    user_input = input(">>> ")
    handle_command(user_input)
```

You can run this script to start the chatbot. The chatbot accepts commands and executes the corresponding actions:

- "run": This command will run the "main.py" program.
- "help": This command will display the available commands.
- "exit": This command will quit the chatbot.

Please note that in order to run the "main.py" program successfully, make sure all the required libraries mentioned in the program are installed in your Python environment.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
